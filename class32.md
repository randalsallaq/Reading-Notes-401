# Permissions


Every data object in Backendless has its own access control list (ACL) - a matrix of operations and principals (application's users or roles). An intersection of an operation and a principal contains a permission which determines whether the principal has the right to execute the operation. These permission could be either grant or deny. Backendless console provides an easy to understand way to see and manage these permissions.
