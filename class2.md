recursion is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.[1] Such problems can generally be solved by iteration, but this needs to identify and index the smaller instances at programming time.

# TDD


Test-driven development is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
