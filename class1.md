# Big O Notation

**Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.**

## O(1):
An algorithm is said to run in constant time if it requires the same amount of time regardless of the input size. Example:
- array: accessing any element

## O(N):
represents the complexity of a function that increases linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs. This is a good example of how Big O Notation describes the worst case scenario as the function could return the true after reading the first element or false after reading all n elements.

## O(N2):
represents a function whose complexity is directly proportional to the square of the input size. Adding more nested iterations through the input will increase the complexity which could then represent O(n3) with 3 total iterations and O(n4) with 4 total iterations.

## O(2N):
 represents a function whose performance doubles for every element in the input. 
 
 
 # Logarithms
 
 A logarithm is a mathematical operation that determines how many times a certain number, called the base, is multiplied by itself to reach another number.
