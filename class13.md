# Linear regression

#### "Linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.[1] This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable."

## Applications:

Linear regression is widely used in biological, behavioral and social sciences to describe possible relationships between variables. It ranks as one of the most important tools used in these disciplines.

### Usage in Machine learning
Linear regression plays an important role in the field of artificial intelligence such as machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms due to its relative simplicity and well-known properties.
* Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.

## The Formula for Multiple Linear Regression
The concept of multiple linear regression can be understood by the following formula-

y = b0+b1*x1+b2*x2+..........+bn*xn

In the equation, y is the single dependent variable value of which depends on more than one independent variable (i.e. x1,x2,...,xn).
