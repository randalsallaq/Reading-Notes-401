# Machine Learning

#### Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.

### The primary aim is 
#### to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.


### Machine Learning Methods:

- ***Supervised machine learning algorithms*** can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events.

- ***unsupervised machine learning algorithms*** are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled.

- ***Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms*** fall somewhere in between supervised and unsupervised learning

- ***Reinforcement machine learning algorithms*** is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards.
