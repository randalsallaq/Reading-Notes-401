# Regular Expressions

### A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp; also referred to as rational expression) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

## match()

The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None. The re module also contains several other functions, and you will learn some of them later on in the tutorial.


## search()

With the search function, you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match.


## group()

The group function returns the string matched by the re. You will see both these functions in more detail later.


## `^` caret 

Matches the start of the string.


## `.` period

Matches any single character except the newline character.
