# Python Scope

#### The scope of a variable refers to the places that you can see or access a variable.

There is two general scopes:

- ***Global scope***: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

- ***Local scope***: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.


# What id LEGB

### LEGB stands for Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in.
The order Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in is the order of precedence for scope resolution. That means Python searches for the value of a name in each of these namespaces in turn.

- ***Local (or function) scope***: The local scope is the scope of all objects in the current namespace.
- ***Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope***: The enclosing scope is the scope of any objects in the namespace that encloses the current namespace, which may or may not exist. 
- ***Global (or module) scope***: The global scope is the scope of objects in the module-level namespace. Creating a variable outside of a function or class will put it in the global namespace.
- ***Built-in scope***: The built-in scope is the scope of all objects that are built into the Python language. Reserved names like dict are found in this namespace.
