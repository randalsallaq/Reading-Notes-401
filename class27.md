# Django Medels

"A model is a class that represents table or collection in our DB, and where every attribute of the class is a field of the table or collection."

# Django Admin

One of the most powerful parts of Django is the automatic admin interface. It reads metadata from your models to provide a quick, model-centric interface where trusted users can manage content on your site. The admin’s recommended use is limited to an organization’s internal management tool. It’s not intended for building your entire front end around.

#### jango-admin is Django’s command-line utility for administrative tasks. 

#### Generally, when working on a single Django project, it’s easier to use manage.py than django-admin. If you need to switch between multiple Django settings files, use django-admin with DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE or the --settings command line option.
