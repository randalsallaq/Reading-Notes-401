# Django Form

### A ModelForm maps a model class's fields to HTML form <input> elements via a Form ; this is what the Django admin is based upon. A form's fields are themselves classes; they manage form data and perform validation when a form is submitted.

## Djangoâ€™s role in forms:

Django handles three distinct parts of the work involved in forms:

- preparing and restructuring data to make it ready for rendering
- creating HTML forms for the data
- receiving and processing submitted forms and data from the client


## Instantiating, processing, and rendering forms

- get hold of it in the view
- pass it to the template context
- expand it to HTML markup using template variables
