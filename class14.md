# Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.

Matplotlib was originally written by John D. Hunter, since then it has an active development community

### Importing Matplotlib

``import matplotlib as mpl

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt``

### Setting Styles

We can will use the plt.style directive to choose appropriate aesthetic styles for our figures. Here we will set the classic style, which ensures that the plots we create use the classic Matplotlib style:

``plt.style.use('classic')``


### Display Plots

A visualization you can't see won't be of much use, but just how you view your Matplotlib plots depends on the context. The best use of Matplotlib differs depending on how you are using it; roughly, the three applicable contexts are using Matplotlib in a script, in an IPython terminal, or in an IPython notebook.

use ``show()``
